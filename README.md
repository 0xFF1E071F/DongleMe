DongleMe
=========

Just a bit of code to test Feitian Rockey4ND dongle, nothing really interesting.
That just some materials i did for a presentation and a paper (private sorry) about software protection in general.

You need to provide p1,p2,p3,p4 into base.asm with your dongle info, i've also included an example of envelopped program and his emulator.
